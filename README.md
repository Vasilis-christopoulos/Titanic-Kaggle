# Titanic-Kaggle
Beginner data analysis project.

Purpose: The purpose of this project is to experiment with data and apply theoretical knowledge on actual data.
Goal: The goal is to create a model that predicts whether the passengers of the Titanic would survive or not.
Approach: In order to address this: 
    - I analyzed the data and gained meaningful insights about them.
    - Performed data cleaning and formatting on them.
    - Perfomed EDA on data
    - Engineered features that improved the model performance
    - Evaluated the models (Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest) and tuned the hyperparameters of the best one.

Conclusion:
The model that seemed to perform the best was XGBoost with a score of 0.79186.
There are more that can be done in order to improve the performance of the models. Further feature engineering, for example providing the model with secondary family information using the lastnames of the passengers could improve performance. Going deeper into tuning the hyperparameters and running more complex models could also improve the score achieved. However, this project is mainly done for educational purposes and that's the reason why I decided to stop here for now.
